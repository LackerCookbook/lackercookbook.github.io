title: Lemon Cream Brussel Sprouts with Bacon and Sage
categories: Sides
---

## Ingredients 

- 2 lbs Brussels sprouts (trimmed and halved)
- 3 slices, thick cut bacon
- 2 shallots, halved and thinly sliced
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 tsp chopped fresh sage leaves
- 1 tsp grated lemon zest

## Directions

1. Bring 4 quarts of lightly salted water to a boil in a large saucepan; add Brussels sprouts. Cook 3 minutes or until crisp-tender. Drain in a colander, then refresh under cold running water to stop cooking.
2. In a large heavy skillet, over medium heat, cook bacon until crisp, about 7 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels, leaving rendered fat in skillet. Put shallots in skillet and saute over medium heat until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add sprouts; saute 3 minutes longer.
3. Add cream, sage, and lemon zest, stirring to mix. Bring mixture to a simmer: reduce heat to medium low. Simmer uncovered until cream is reduced and thickens to a glaze that loosely coats sprouts, about 3 minutes. Stir in lemon juice and add salt and pepper to taste. Crumble cooked bacon on top and serve immediately.
